# PROJECT - SLIDE (SMART PARK)

- SLIDE is a web application designed for SMART parking in colleges, institutions and other organisations.
- The user's vehicle is scanned on the various entry gates and a message is sent on his registered phone number from where he can choose the destination he wants to go.
- Thereafter he will receive the location to the nearest parking lot according to his chosen destination


### OUR PROBLEM STATEMENT
Due to the increase in traffic on roads, it is difficult to reach our
destination places on time, and finding the nearest parking space for four-wheeler parking is tedious. It would be beneficial to have an intelligent
application that provides a real-time parking slot within your destination
area as soon as the car enters a specific point


### BENEFITS AND IMAPCT
- SLIDE is a complete, end-to-end solution that pairs a network of sensors, feature displays and live gateways with a powerful and intuitive web-based platform.
- Infinitely scalable, the beauty of our system lies in the user-friendly dashboard which enables customers to manage and analyse events and information, as well as allowing users to identify trends and interpret data.
- Solving our problem statement, i.e. SLIDE helps in finding a parking slot nearest to their destination
- SLIDE works closely with parking operators who either own and manage a portfolio of car parks under their own brand, or who manage a car park for a client.
- Campuses always provide a unique challenge with regards to parking, as not only do they tend to occupy multiple car parks on a sprawling footprint, but they also need to cater for the different needs of students and staff. So SLIDE assists the user with diverting them to the ideal destination they select to give them most limited way saving their time and making the parking places more coordinated


### OUR IDEA DESCRIPTION
- Our main aim is to provide users an easy way to find the parking slots in the supermarket/college campus/universities which would save the time of the students and the professors.
- We would offer them an opportunity to book their slot from home for an amount of time if they wish to do so. We will be giving access to their past parking records also and their common spots at the regular basis.
- We are trying to implement the same all over the city which will give the users to see the slots from their home to the desired location and then plan accordingly


### IMPLEMENTATION
- As of now, we scan the Vehicle Number at different gates of the campus National Institute of Technology, Rourkela and then ask the driver to enter the desired location he wants to go.
- The web application checks the Parking Database i.e empty parking spaces nearest to the destination he has chosen and then shows him the shortest path to the location.
- If the parking slots are filled in that location, we send him to the next nearest spot from the location he chose and then update the same on our parking Database which helps the next user to see and park in the same way

### FUTURE ASPECTS
- Using this idea with the implementation of Internet of Things which will increase the efficiency and the working for several locations all over the city.
- Providing certain access to the parking slot manager which would help him to manage the slots all by himself.
- Implementing the same to the parking spots from the busy roads of city/malls /supemarkets which would help user to see the parking slot availability from their home to any location which doesn't have fixed parking slot.
